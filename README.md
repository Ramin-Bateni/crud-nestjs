## Description

Task for interview

I started with basics, set foundations for CQRS and implement the module, then went for separating read and write models.

Also, I'm familiar with frontend development too, but due to full-time job I'm in now, I couldn't put enough time.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# bdd tests
$ npm run test:bdd
```

## Deployment

```bash
# run the dockerized version of the app
docker compose up -d
```
