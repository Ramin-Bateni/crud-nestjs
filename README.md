## Description

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) test application built with NestJS framework. The project follows a clean architecture approach with separate layers for domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation concerns.

## Project Structure

The project is organized using a clean architecture pattern with the following structure:

```
src/
├── customer/
│   ├── domain/         # Business entities and rules
│   ├── application/    # Use cases and business logic
│   ├── infrastructure/ # Database implementations, repositories
│   └── presentation/   # Controllers, DTOs, and API endpoints
├── app.module.ts       # Root module configuration
└── main.ts            # Application entry point
```

## Features

- Customer management system with CRUD operations
- Clean architecture implementation
- TypeScript-based development
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

Make sure to:
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- Use different values for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Keep sensitive information secure

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Running the application

```bash
# Development mode
$ npm run start:dev

# Production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# Unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## API Documentation

The API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api` when the application is running.

## Development

This project uses:
- NestJS v11
- TypeScript
- Jest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
